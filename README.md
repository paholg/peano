# Peano

Peano is a library for type-level numbers in Rust. It has been supplanted by
[typenum](../typenum), which does the same things (and more) and is ***much*** faster.

The advantage of peano is that it is much simpler; the entire library is a single file
that is under 400 lines of code, many of which are comments.

So, take a look if you want to explore type-level programming. If you want to import a
library, use typenum.
